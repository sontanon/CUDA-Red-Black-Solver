Since the program has been divided into multiple files, each .cu file must me compiled into an object file
and when all object files are ready, they can be compiled into an executable.

Each object file must be compiled as 

$ nvcc -arch=sm_20 -dc -I. file.cu -o file.obj

The reason for separate file compilation is that there are __device__ functions that must be dealt as 
mentioned in the following link:

As already said, after compiling all objects we compile the executable as:

$ nvcc -arch=sm_20 file1.obj file2.obj ... fileN.obj -o app.exe
